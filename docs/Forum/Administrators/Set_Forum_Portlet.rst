Hover your cursor over the **Forum** portlet, then click |image6| in the
quick toolbar to open the Edit Mode tab.

This form allows you to configure the **Forum** portlet in various
aspects via the following actions:

**Specifying the category scoping**

In the Scoping tab, you can show/hide categories and forums in the
**Forum** portlet by selecting or deselecting their respective
checkboxes.

**Enabling/Disabling Forums components**

In the Panels tab, you can enable/disable some components in the Forum
portlet by simply selecting/deselecting checkboxes of the components
respectively.

The following components can be enabled/disabled:

-  Show `Poll <#ForumSubmittedPoll>`__

-  Moderators

-  Show `Quick Reply <#QuickReplyBox>`__

-  Show Icons Legend

-  Show Rules

-  Show Statistics

**Enabling/Disabling a bookmarkable Forums URL**

Before doing this function, you first need to have knowledge of Ajax.
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is used in the **Forums**
application, aiming at updating a whole webpage or a part of the
webpage.

This feature defines how the links are generated in the **Forum**
portlet. You can select to use Ajax or not.

-  By not using Ajax, **Forums** will generate plain URLs in the links.
   The added benefit will be bookmarkability and better SEO as the links
   will be permalinks.

-  Using Ajax, the links will be Javascript based and generate Ajax
   calls. This makes your browsing faster because the whole page is not
   reloaded.
