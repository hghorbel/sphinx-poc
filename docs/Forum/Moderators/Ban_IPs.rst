Banning IPs
===========

This function allows banning IPs that may be used by users who abuse the
forum functions or violate the forum rules and policies.

This function is similar to the `Banning IPs tool used by
administrators <#PLFUserGuide.BuildingYourForum.Administrator.AdministrativeTasks.BanningIPs>`__.
However, the Ban IPs tool used by administrators can ban IP from all
forums, while moderators can only ban IP from forums which he manages.

**Banning IP on a specific forum**

Go to the forum you want to ban IP.

Click |image0| on the Action bar, then select Banned IPs from the
drop-down menu. The Banned IPs form opens.

Do the `same actions <#Administration.BanIPs>`__ as the **`Banning
IPs <#PLFUserGuide.BuildingYourForum.Administrator.AdministrativeTasks.BanningIPs>`__**
section of Administrators.
