'`Moderate Topic <#AdminModerateTopics>`__\ ' option. All new topics
added to these forums will be pending for approval. It means that nobody
can view these topics except administrators and moderators of the
forums. Pending topics are only viewable for regular users when they are
approved.

The administrator and moderator will know the total number of pending
topics at the right corner of their Forums Administration bar and User
bar.
