Bookmarks
=========

In the **Forums** application, the **Bookmark** function is to collect
links to a category, forum or topic you have visited, so that you can
return to that category, forum or topic directly. Bookmarks can be
created and managed by yourself through the following actions:

**Adding a bookmark**

This function is for all logged-in users to save links to categories,
forums or topics into the Forum Bookmark.

Go into the object (category, forum or topic) you want to bookmark.

Click |image0| on the Action bar;

Or, right-click the object title and select Bookmarks from the drop-down
menu. The bookmarked link will be added to your bookmarks list.

**Viewing a bookmark**

To view a bookmark, click |image1| on your **User** bar. This will bring
up the My Bookmarks form, with the list of your bookmarked links. To
view a bookmark, click your desired bookmark title from the list.

**Deleting a bookmark**

Simply click |image2| corresponding to the link that you want to delete.

The selected bookmarks will be removed from the bookmarks list.
