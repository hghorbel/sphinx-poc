Creating/Editing a group chat
=============================

By creating a group chat, you can share work, knowledge and plans with
your colleagues more efficiently. In BRAND\_CHAT, the "group chat"
denotes discussion among space/team members. Your spaces (that you are
owner or member) are auto-listed into the Spaces pane.
