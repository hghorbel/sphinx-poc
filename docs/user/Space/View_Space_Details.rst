View details of a space
=======================

To view one detailed page of a space, you must become its member first.
Then, do either of the two following ways to view the space.

**The first way**

-  Hover your cursor over My Spaces on the **Administration** bar, and
   select your desired space from the drop-down menu.

**The second way**

-  After entering the My Spaces pane within the Spaces application,
   click the name of your desired space.

The detailed page of the space displays information about the space. The
functions you can perform depend on your granted permissions or whether
you are the space's creator or not.

As a normal user, you can:

-  `Ask for joining the public space or leaving the
   space <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingSpaces.JoiningLeavingSpace>`__.

-  `Accept or deny to join a
   space <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingSpaces.AcceptingIgnoringInvitations>`__.

-  `Invite new members to take part in your
   space <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingSpaces.EditingSpace.ManagingMembers.InvitingMem>`__.

Besides the actions above, as a space manager or creator, you can:

-  `Edit the space settings, including description, priority level, and
   avatar <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingSpaces.EditingSpace>`__.

-  `Change the visibility of your
   space <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingSpaces.EditingSpace.ChangingVisibility>`__.

-  `Promote/Demote roles of space
   members <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingSpaces.EditingSpace.ManagingMembers.PromotingMember>`__.

-  `Remove members from your
   space <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingSpaces.EditingSpace.ManagingMembers.RemovingMember>`__.

-  `Delete a space <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingSpaces.DeletingSpace>`__

**Delete a space**

Only the space managers can delete their spaces by clicking
<guilabel>Delete</guilabel> under the space name. All information and
navigations related to that space are also deleted.
