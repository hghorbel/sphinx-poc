About user roles
================

In the **Knowledge** application, each user group has different
privileges to perform actions. Some actions can be limited to some
specific user groups. Advanced users have the ability to control and
assign functions or features that other users can and cannot do within
the application. There are five user groups: administrator, moderator,
regular user, banned user and guest.

-  **Administrator** is an advanced user, who typically has the highest
   right when using Knowledge. The Administrator can manage user
   privileges and he has rights to perform all possible capabilities.
   For example, in Forum, an administrator can create categories,
   close/delete, lock/unlock forums; promote a regular user to moderator
   or create a category that is restricted to a specific user group.

-  **Moderator** obtains a subset of administrator's rights. It means
   that he has certain allowed capabilities and may perform these
   advanced actions in a specific area only. For example, a moderator of
   a category in Forum can only perform advanced actions in the category
   that he is assigned as the moderator. The moderator role is assigned
   by the administrator.

-  **Regular user** is defined as a logged-in user who can only use the
   basic features of Knowledge. The regular user can be promoted to the
   advanced user by the administrator.

-  **Banned user** is a regular user, that abuses the forum functions or
   violates the forum rules and policies, cannot use the basic features
   of Knowledge. The role of the banned user is similar to an anonymous
   user's.

-  **Guest** (anonymous user) is an unregistered/unlogged-in user who is
   often limited to a very few features only of Knowledge. For instance,
   a guest can view topics in Forum but he cannot reply or create new
   topics.

Notice that there will be no section dedicated to anonymous users. You
can refer to the table that summarizes all the actions that different
user roles can perform in each application.
