Sharing a personal calendar
===========================

This function allows you to share your personal calendar with other
users, so that they can participate in all activities of this calendar.

You can set permissions on your shared calendar based on 2 levels:

-  **View permission** allows shared users to view the shared calendar
   and its events/tasks, but cannot change any information. It means
   that the shared users cannot add/edit/delete events or tasks, or
   edit, import and export the shared calendar.

-  **Edit permission** allows shared users to view, import and export
   the shared calendar or add, edit, delete events/tasks inside the
   shared calendar. However, you cannot edit detailed information of a
   shared calendar, such as its display name.

    **Note**

    If other users share their calendars with you, you will see them in
    the **Shared Calendars** category even after the users `are
    suspended <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingYourOrganization.ManagingUsers.DisablingUser>`__.

   calendar:

   -  Remove and Refresh, if the Read permission only is granted.

**Sharing a calendar using iCal**

iCal provides a link that allows users to download a *\*.ics* file which
contains all events and tasks of a calendar. iCal is supported by many
popular products, such as Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, Apple
iCal.

-  **Public URL**: The Public URL link allows you to share your calendar
   with other users. They do not need to have Calendar accounts to
   download the file, but they must use a calendar application which
   supports the .ics to open and view it. By default, Public URL is
   empty and it is only accessible when public access is explicitly
   enabled.

-  **Private URL**: iCal is used for personal use. It means that as the
   creator of the calendar, you can download it to your computer and use
   any calendar applications which support the .ics format to open it.
   You can also import it into another calendar.

**Getting the link to download iCal**

Hover your cursor over the calendar which you want to get iCal, then
click |image3| that appears.

Click Edit from the drop-down menu to open the Calendar form.

Get a Public URL or Private URL by clicking |image4|. For Public URL,
you must assure that the iCal is public. If it is not public, simply
click the "Disable Public Access" link.

One Calendar Feed form will pop up.

Copy the link in the Calendar Feed form, then send it to another users.
The shared users can use this link to download the *.ics* file which can
be opened in popular calendar applications, such as Microsoft Outlook,
Google Calendar, Apple iCal.
