Page versions
=============

When editing the content of a page, **Wiki** will automatically create a
version of that page after it is saved. Thanks to the page versions, you
can make changes on the page safely and roll back to an earlier version
without worrying about messing things up.

In the `Page
History <#PLFUserGuide.WorkingWithWikis.ManagingContent.ManagingContentChanges.WorkingWithPageVersions.ViewingPageHistory>`__
view, you can see all versions of a page.

By default, the version of a page is displayed in the header, and each
version includes the following information:

-  Revision numbers.

-  Author making changes.

-  Date and time when changes are made.

-  Summary (if any).

    **Note**

    All functions, including viewing, comparing and restoring, can also
    be done by clicking the Revisions link at the Page Info bar. One
    pop-up pane appears right under this bar, allowing you to do the
    same steps as described below.

**Viewing a page history**

To access the page history, just click View Page History in the `Page
Info <#PLFUserGuide.WorkingWithWikis.ManagingContent.AddingAndEditingPages.AddingRelatedPages>`__
view.

The **Page History** appears.

In which:

-  |image0|: Compares selected page versions.

-  |image1|: Selects two versions that you want to compare.

-  |image2|: Specifies the version labels of the page and link to view a
   specific version.

-  |image3|: The date and time when the page is changed.

-  |image4|: The authors who make changes of the page.

-  |image5|: The reasons why the changes are made (optional).

-  |image6|: Restores a page to the selected version.

**Viewing versions of a page**

To view a specific version of a page, just click a version label in the
**Page History** page. The selected version of that page will be
displayed.

At a version of the page, you can do the following actions:

-  Compare the current version with the selected one |image7|.

-  Replace the current version with the selected version |image8|.

-  Go to the **Page History** page |image9|.

-  View content of the previous version by selecting Prev.

-  View content of the next version by selecting Next.

**Comparing page versions**

**Wiki** keeps track of histories of changes on a page by maintaining a
version of the page each time it is modified. To compare two versions,
select two checkboxes corresponding to each relevant version, then click
Compare the selected versions.

A page which shows the changes between these two versions will be
displayed.

The changes between two versions will be marked with colors:

-  Words/lines which are red-highlighted with strike-throughs indicate
   that they were removed.

-  Words/lines highlighted in green indicate that they were added.

    **Note**

    Only two revisions can be selected at one time.

**Restoring a page version**

When you notice that there are changes in the current page version that
you are not satisfied, you can rollback to an older version of that page
quickly.

To restore to an older version, click |image10| corresponding to your
desired version in the **Page History** page.

    **Note**

    Restoring to an older version will create a copy of that version.
    For example, if the [current version (v.2)] is restored to the
    [older version (v.1)], **Wiki** will create a new version (v.3)
    containing content of v.1. The version v.3 will become the current
    version.
