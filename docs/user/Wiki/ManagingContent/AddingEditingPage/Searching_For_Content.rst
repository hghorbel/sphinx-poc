Search
======

In **Wiki**, you can search for spaces, or pages in a space, or attached
files via either of 2 types:

-  `Quick Search <#PLFUserGuide.BuildWiki.Search.QuickSearch>`__

-  `Advanced Search <#PLFUserGuide.BuildWiki.AdvancedSearch>`__

**Quick Search**

Enter a keyword into the search box.

Select your desired page from the drop-down menu. You will be redirected
to the selected page.

    **Note**

    If you are in the portal wiki, your quick search will be performed
    on all wiki spaces, otherwise it will only be performed on the
    current wiki.

**Advanced Search**

The Advanced Search function allows you to search with a keyword in a
specific space. This mode helps you limit the search results.

Enter a key term into the search box, then hit the **Enter** key.

The search results are displayed like the illustration below.

If there is no result matched with the keywords, the search screen
informs "there is no search result...!"

Click |image0| to select a space from the drop-down menu to define a
scale where to search for the entered word.

Click Search.
