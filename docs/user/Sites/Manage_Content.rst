Managing content in a specific site
===================================

Web content is a key resource which is used for a site. Other resources
make a site more dynamic and animated by using layout, color, font, and
more. This section focuses on how to manage web content in a specific
site via the Sites Management drive which allows you to manage content
of all sites in the portal.

This section consists of the following topics:

-  **`Creating new web
   content <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourWebsites.ManagingContentInSitesExplorer.CreatingNewWebContent>`__**

   Instructions on how to create new web content in a specific site.

-  **`Editing/Publishing/Deleting web
   content <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourWebsites.ManagingContentInSitesExplorer.EditingPublishingDeletingWebContent>`__**

    **Note**

    Only users who have the right to access the Sites Management drive
    can do it.

Creating new web content

to add web content.

    (documents and media folders) of a site but you are recommended to
    select the **web content** folder because:

    -  Managing web content of a site becomes more easily.

    -  You do not have to select many web content types in the list of
       document types. It makes adding new web content more flexibly.

templates <#content_templates>`__, including Illustrated Web Content,
