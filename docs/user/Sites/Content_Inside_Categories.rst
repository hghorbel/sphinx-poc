Creating content inside a category
==================================

In PRODUCT, you can create new content in any folders or directly in a
CLV with **Incontext Editing.** However, to facilitate the content
management, categories which are usually used to sort and organize
documents make your desired searches more quickly. Also, creating
content inside a category helps you manage and publish them effectively.

After creating a document, you should categorize it by adding it to a
category. Otherwise, documents should be created right in a category and
links to those documents will be automatically created in the category.
In PRODUCT, categories are stored in JCR.
