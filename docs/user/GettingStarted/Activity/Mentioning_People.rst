Mentioning someone
==================

Mention is a way to refer to people so that they are informed of who and
what you are talking about. Mentioning someone is possible in activity
stream composer, activities comments and also document comments. To
mention someone, do as follows:

Type the "@" symbol into the activity/comment composer, then type the
person name you want to mention.

A suggestion list that contains matching characters will appear.

Only one person can be selected at one time.

    **Note**

    When mentionning a user with "@", it displays **in first positions**
    contacts in your connections, **then** other people

Go through the suggestion list with the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys or by
moving your cursor over it, then click or hit the "Enter" key to
validate your selected person.

    **Note**

    Only one person can be selected at one time.

After being validated, "@" and following characters will be replaced
with First name and Last name which are wrapped in a label. You can
click [x] in the label to dismiss it.

In the Activity Stream, the mention is displayed as a link to the
mentioned user's profile page.

    **Note**

    -  You can do the same steps above to mention someone in your
       comments (document comments and activity comments).

    -  The person you mention also sees the post in his/her Activity
       Stream.

    -  Document comments appears also in the Activity Stream.
