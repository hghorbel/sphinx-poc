Revoking a connection request
=============================

After sending connection requests to other users and they are not
accepted yet, you still can remove the requests by doing one of the
following ways:

**The first way**

Select the Requests Pending tab in the My Connections page.

Click **Cancel Request** under the contact name, or hover your cursor
over the contact name and click Cancel Request to revoke the connection
request.

**The second way**

`Access the profile page of the
contact <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourPersonalApplications.ManagingYourConnections.ViewingProfileOfOtherContacts>`__
to whom you sent a connection request, then click **Cancel Request**.
