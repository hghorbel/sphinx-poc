Besides the search feature in each application, PRODUCT provides a
robust search tool which allows you to search for all types of content
right in Social Intranet. With this new search feature, you are able to
search for everything without accessing each specific application. This
means the productivity will be much enhanced as you can search for any
content at any location with just few clicks away from the search box on
the navigation bar.

**Performing quick search**

Click |image0| on the top navigation bar to open the search box.

Enter your search term into the Search box.

This search displays quick results in the drop-down menu. These results
are grouped by their types: Files, Documents, Wiki, Pages, Discussions,
People, Spaces, Events, Tasks, Questions and Answers. By default, the
quick search returns results for content located in the current site
only.

Select your desired result from the drop-down menu to directly access
it;

Or, hit the **Enter** key, or click |image2|, or click See All Search
Results to view all results in the search main panel.

**Preview documents on search results**

After having the search results list that corresponds to the keyword
used in the search box, you can preview an element from that list either
in `Documents
Application <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourDocuments.DocumentsInterface>`__
or with the `document
viewer <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourDocuments.DocumentViewer>`__. It is
also possible to download it.

   to click on the document's icon.

   need to click on the document's link or in the button Open in
   Documents after previewing it in document viewer.

Sorting and filtering your results
----------------------------------

In the search main panel, you can further restrict the search scope to
streamline the returned results.

**Sorting your results**

By selecting the **Sort By** drop-down menu, you can narrow your search
results.

-  Relevance: This type is set by default for search and in the
   descending order. This means the search results will be sorted by the
   connection with the entered terms. The top result is one which has
   the closest relevance with the entered term.

-  Date: This type displays results by the last created/modified date in
   the descending order.

-  Title: This type displays results by their title based on the
   ascending (alphanumeric) order.

    **Note**

    If you select each Sort option again, the order type will be
    changed. This means "ascending" is changed into "descending" and
    vice versa.

**Filtering your results**

The **Filter By** panel is displayed on the left side, allowing you to
control the search range by sites and content types.

|image5|

-  All Sites: A list of sites on which the search action is performed.

-  All Content Types: A list of content types by which the search action
   is performed.

By default, all checkboxes are ticked. To exclude some result types from
the results page, simply untick the corresponding checkbox.
