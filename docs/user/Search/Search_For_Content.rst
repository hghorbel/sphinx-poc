Searching for Wiki pages
========================

Enter a keyword into the search box.

Select your desired page from the drop-down menu. You will be redirected
to the selected page;

    **Note**

    If you are in the portal wiki, your quick search will be performed
    on all wiki spaces, otherwise it will only be performed on the
    current wiki.

Or, hit the **Enter** key to go to the result page.

The search results are displayed like the illustration below.

If there is no result matched with the keywords, the search screen
informs no result for your search keywords.

Optionally, you can change your search scope by selecting another
location from the drop-down menu.
