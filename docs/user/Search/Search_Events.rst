Searching for events
====================

This function allows finding existing events according to specific
search conditions easily. There are 2 search types: **Quick search** and
**Advanced search**.

**Quick search**

This function allows you to do a quick search with specific keywords in
all your events/tasks. All events having the text matching with your
search term will be returned.

Enter a word in the Search field at the right corner of the toolbar.

Click Search to perform your search. All events matching with your
criteria will be listed in the results form.

    **Note**

    In the Search Result form, you can click an event to view it, or
    edit/delete an event by clicking |image3|/ |image4| at the bottom.

    **Note**

    If you are searching for a recurring event using Quick search,
    notice that the search returns those that occur in 2 years in the
    future. This limit is to prevent an infinite result, so it does not
    impact non-recurrences.

    In Advanced search, if you leave the To Date field blank, the 2-year
    limit is also applied. So you can search for occurrences later than
    2 years by filling in that field.
