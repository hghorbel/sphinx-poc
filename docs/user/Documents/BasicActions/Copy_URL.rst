Copying URL to clipboard
========================

The **Copy URL To Clipboard** feature enables you to copy the WebDAV URL
of content. You then can view it using the WebDAV client as stated in
`WebDAV <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.WebDAV>`__.

Select the content you want to copy its URL, then click |image0| from
the Right-click menu or on the Action bar.

    **Note**

    If you do not see |image1| on the Action bar, find it from the More
    drop-down menu.

Paste the URL on another tab.

You can view the content you copied its URL or download it to your local
device. You can also view other folders by clicking **...** above the
current folder to go up its root.
