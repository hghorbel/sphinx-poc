Voting for a document
=====================

The Vote feature is used to assign a rating to a document. In PRODUCT,
you can vote for a document via the 5-star rating. The more stars you
select, the higher rating you evaluate.

Open the document for which you want to vote, then select |image0| on
the Action bar.

The Vote Document form appears.

-  **Avg. Rating:** The average value of all votes assigned to the
   document.

-  **Votes:** The number of votes assigned to the document.

    **Note**

    You can change your rating for a specific document by selecting the
    star level again and the rating system automatically updates and
    calculates your last rating.
