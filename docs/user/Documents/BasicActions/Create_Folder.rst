If you create a new folder in a drive which allows creating more than
one folder type, you will see the Use a custom type of folder checkbox.
For example, in the **Collaboration** drive:

-  By default, if you do not select the Use a custom type of folder
   checkbox, a Document Folder type will be created. Tick this checkbox,
   then select another folder type from the drop-down menu.

Enter a folder name, then click Create Folder to finish.

    **Note**

    -  The name of a folder may be the same as that of the existing
       ones. In this case, an index will be added to your newly created
       folder that can be seen on the address bar.

    -  The list of available folder types which can be created in each
       drive is different depending on the drive configuration.
    -  Child folders will have the same folder type as that of their
       parent folders.
