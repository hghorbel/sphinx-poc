Filtering
=========

You can organize your content effectively based on the existing filters
on the sidebar in the main view. Thus, to filter your content, you need
to `enable the sidebar <#EnableSideBar>`__ first.

Next, find out your content quickly by selecting:

-  Owned by me to show your own ones.

-  Favorites to show ones added to favorites.

-  Hidden to show hidden ones.

-  Filter By Type to show ones by various types, including: Content,
   Document, Image, Music and Video.

    **Note**

    You can combine more than one filter at one time to find out your
    desired content.
