Creating a symlink
==================

A symlink is a special type of document that points to one file or
folder.

To add a symlink, simply select |image0| from the Right-click menu or on
the Action bar. The symlink will be added to the selected document
immediately that is marked with |image1|.

    **Note**

    -  When you perform an action on a symlink, the action is also
       performed on the content to which the symlink points.

    -  When you delete a symlink, you delete the link's content, not the
       content to which the symlink points.
