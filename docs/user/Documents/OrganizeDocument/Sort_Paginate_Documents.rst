Sorting/Paginating
==================

**Sorting your content**

In the **List** view, your content can be found easily and quickly by
using the **Sort** option. You can arrange your content by sorting them
to Name, Date and Size in ascending or descending order.

    **Note**

    If you select each Sort option again, the order type will be
    changed. This means "ascending" is changed into "descending" and
    vice versa.

**Paginating**

Instead of scrolling all your content in the long list, you can use
Paginator to organize them into separate pages.

The Paginator value is set to "20" by default. This means the Paginator
button will be visible if the content number exceeds 20.

To change the Paginator value, simply click |image2| and pick another
one from the Nodes Per Page drop-down list.
