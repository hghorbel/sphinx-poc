The content management is one of key strategies in the organizational
process of each enterprise. A good content management allows you to:

-  Store, share and work on the same content efficiently.

-  Trace changes of content intuitively and instantly.

-  Simplify the way to manage your content.

The Enterprise Content Management system delivered by PRODUCT not only
satisfies basic demands (for example, uploading, previewing and
sharing/editing), but also makes useful capabilities available
(versioning, metadata, advanced searches, and more). These new
management solutions featured in the **Documents** application are built
on existing content management capabilities in a flexible and practical
way.
