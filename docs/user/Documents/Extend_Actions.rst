Extending your actions
======================

In addition to basic actions stated above, PRODUCT provides a list of
additional features for managing your content. Some of extended features
are set in the **Admin** view by default, or your administrator can
enable them for any specific views.

    **Note**

    This part is mostly for administrators who have right to access the
    `Content
    Administration <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ContentAdministration>`__
    page where extended actions can be activated.

The followings are additional actions which are not accessible in the
**List** and **Icons** views, but are set by default in the **Admin**
view:

-  `Managing
   actions <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourDocuments.ExtendingYourActions.ManagingActions>`__

-  `Activating document
   audit <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourDocuments.ExtendingYourActions.ActivatingDocumentAudit>`__

   properties <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourDocuments.ExtendingYourActions.ViewingAddingDocumentProperties>`__

-  `Managing document
   relations <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourDocuments.ExtendingYourActions.ManagingDocumentRelations>`__

Besides, administrators can add more actions to any views. The
followings are recommended features you may discover.

-  `Exporting <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourDocuments.ExtendingYourActions.Exporting>`__

    **List** view by your administrator. Therefore, you will see them in
    the Action bar.
