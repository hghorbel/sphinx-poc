menu.

Edit the forum properties. See `Managing
forums <#PLFUserGuide.BuildingYourForum.Administrator.ManagingForums>`__
for more details.

Locking/Unlocking a forum
-------------------------

Locking a forum will prevent all members from creating new topics and
posting replies in this forum. All topics in a locked forum will be
locked also, but their content is still viewable. Moderators can only
lock/unlock the forum that they manage.

Go into the forum.

Click |image1| on the Action bar, then click Lock/Unlock from the
drop-down menu.

    **Note**

    You can also lock/unlock a forum while `editing the
    forum <#PLFUserGuide.BuildingYourForum.Moderator.ModeratingForums.EditingForum>`__
    by selecting the Locked/Unlocked status.

Closing/Opening a forum
-----------------------

Closed forums are invisible to regular users. To administrators and
moderators, the content in a closed forum is still viewable, but
creating topics and comments is disabled. Moderators can only close the
forum that they are assigned to manage.

Go into the forum you want to close or open.

Click |image2| on the Action bar, then select Close or Open from the
drop-down menu.

    **Note**

    You can also close/open a forum while `editing the
    forum <#PLFUserGuide.BuildingYourForum.Moderator.ModeratingForums.EditingForum>`__
    by selecting the Closed/Open state.
