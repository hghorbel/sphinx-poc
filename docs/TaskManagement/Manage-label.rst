Managing labels
===============

The Task Management application provides you with another tool
to classify tasks on your own, which is called *Labels*. You will be
able to personally label your tasks and this will not affect other users
as well as noone can see them but you.

This part introduces you how to:

* :ref:`Create a label/sub-label <CreateLabel>`
* :ref:`Edit a label <EditLabel>`
* :ref:`Show/Hide a label <ShowHideLabel>`
* :ref:`Change label color <ChangeLabelColor>`
* :ref:`Delete a label <DeleteLabel>`

    In the second way, the created label will be a sub-label under the
    corresponding label.

Fill the label name in the text box that appears, for instance:
