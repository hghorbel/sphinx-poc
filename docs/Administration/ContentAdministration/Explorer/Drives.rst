Drives
======

Drive is a shortcut to a specific location in the content repository
that enables administrators to limit visibility of each workspace for
groups of users. It is also a simple way to hide the complexity of the
content storage by showing only the structure that is helpful for
business users.

Currently, PRODUCT presets 6 drive types. However, the number of drives
you can access depend on your user role. Also, these drives use the
various views. See the following table to make distinction between
drives:
