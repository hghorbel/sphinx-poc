Notification administration
===========================

PRODUCT allows administrators to enable/disable notification plugins in
the administrative interface.

To do so, simply select |image0| Portal Notifications on the top
administration bar.

The Activity Notification Administration page will be displayed as
below:

-  Notification types: Enables or disables notification types globally.

   -  Notification: Name and categories of the notifications.

   -  Title: Title of the notification that will be shown in the email.

   -  Enable: Enables or disables sending the email notifications for
      each corresponding notification type.

-  Name: Defines the display name of the email sender in the **From**
   field.

-  Address: Defines the email address of the sender in the **From**
   field. It must be in the correct form, such as username@abc.com.

    **Note**

    -  Once a notification type is disabled, it will disappear from the
       Notification Settings page of all users, and no new notification
       of this type is sent anymore.

    -  The **My Tasks** settings are available only if the `Task
       Management <#PLFUserGuide.WorkingWithTasks>`__ add-on is
       installed.
