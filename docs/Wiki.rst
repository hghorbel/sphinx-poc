Working With Wikis
####################


    The **Wiki** application provides the content productivity to portal
    users as a tool to forge the unstructured knowledge. With **Wiki**,
    you can create and edit pages by using a simplified markup language
    or a WYSIWYG editor. Also, your company can use **Wiki** as an
    internal reference, such as work policy or a public wiki for
    comprehensive product information. **Wiki** along with **Forums**
    will complete the ideal combination that helps users enhance their
    experiences on collaboration activities and build valuable knowledge
    center for clients.

    This chapter covers the following topics:

:ref:`Managing your content <Managing-Content>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Steps to perform common actions on a Wiki page (for example,
       creating, editing, using the editor, managing drafts, adding a
       related page, and attaching files); information about spreading
       your content; how to manage page changes (by comparing between 2
       versions or by watching); and ways to organize your content.

:ref:`Advanced settings <AdvancedSettings>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Steps specified for administrators to change space settings,

.. _Navigate-across-spaces:

Navigating across spaces
-------------------------

The breadcrumb in Wiki shows the :ref:`page hierarchy <Page-hierarchy-wiki>` to
help you know where you are staying. Additionally, you can navigate to
another space right in the breadcrumb of the current Wiki navigation. To
quickly switch to another space, simply click the currently browsed
space name:

Type your desired space name in the search box to filter the space and
click your space name from the search results. Then you will be
redirected to the Wiki home of the selected space. The "**My Wiki**\ "
and "**Intranet**\ " are displayed by default, which will direct you to
the homepage of your personal Wiki and Intranet Wiki accordingly.


.. note::Only spaces where you are their member are displayed in the search result.

.. _Page-hierarchy-wiki:

Page hierarchy in Wiki
-----------------------

The **Wiki** content is organized as a page tree in which each page may
contain many sub-pages. The hierarchy is reflected on UI by the
**Breadcrumb** and the page tree in the left pane. When a page is added,
it is always defined as a sub-page to the current one. You can have
wikis for portals, wikis for groups or users.

.. _Wiki-spaces:

Wiki Spaces
-------------

Space is a set of pages, so the spaces partitioning means that spaces
are independent trees. This separation enables **Wiki** to provide
knowledge spaces for different groups.

There are 3 space types:

-  **Intranet wiki**: The global wiki of the Social Intranet.

An Intranet wiki is published for every user who can access that portal.

-  **Group wiki**: The wiki of a space.

A group wiki can be understood as a space wiki. The wiki application of
a space works as a group wiki for that space. The group wiki can be
accessed by members of that group.

For example:

-  **User wiki**: The wiki of an individual user.

Every user has his own Wiki. You can switch to **My Wiki** from the
Select Location drop-down menu or from the drop-down menu of the display
name. See :ref:`Working with your wiki <Working-Wiki>` for more details.

.. note:: In this document, Spaces are referred as wikis, particularly portal
			wikis, group wikis and user wikis.
			Any space which has an implicit root page is named Wiki Home.
