Access Sites Explorer
=====================

This page is used to manage all documents in different drives. This is
really a flexible way because you can do through Internet whenever and
wherever. By default, anyone can access **Sites Explorer,** but the
ability to do actions on **Sites Explorer** depends on the role of each
user.

Hover your cursor over |image0| on the Administration bar, then select
ContentSites Explorer from the drop-down menu.

A list of all drives organized in groups (**Personal** drives, **Group**
drives and **General** drives) in the **Sites Explorer** are displayed.

**Personal drives**
    This is the working space of a user. If you want to do in private,
    select the **Private** drive, no one else can access or get your
    private resources. If you want to create resources and share them
    with others, work in the **Public** drive.

**Group drives**
    The working space of users of a specific group.

    In the following example, the user "root" joins in three groups:
    "executive-board", "administrators" and "users" so he has the right
    to access these groups' drives.

**General drives**
    This is the working space for everyone but your access right in
    different drives depends on your role. If you access as an
    administrator role, you can see all drives; otherwise, you can see
    some drives only as a web contributor role.
