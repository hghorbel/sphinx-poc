Managing content list viewer by query
=====================================

The **Content By Query** portlet allows you to collect and display data
throughout a workspace by using a query instead of selecting items by a
folder or by content.

To use this portlet, first you need to add the **Content By Query**
portlet to a specific page as follows:

Drag and drop the **Content By Query** portlet from the Page Editor
Applications Content to the main pane. This can be done while `creating
a new
page <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPages.AddingNewPage>`__
or `editing an existing
page <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPages.EditingPage>`__
or `editing the layout of a
site <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingSites.EditingSite.EditingLayout>`__.
