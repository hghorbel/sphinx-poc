WebDAV support in Wiki
======================

To make easy for Wiki resources management, you can access these
resources using WebDAV. Besides the way stated
`here <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.WebDAV>`__, you can use
the following URL format to access the Wiki resources:

-  `http://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcrwiki/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path} <http://mycompany.com:port/rest/jcrwiki/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path}>`__

-  `dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcrwiki/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path} <dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/jcrwiki/{RepositoryName}/{WorkspaceName}/{Path}>`__

Accordingly, to access the Wiki Home of the "Support Team" space over
Nautilus - the file manager for example, you can use either of the
following URLs:

-  `dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcrwiki/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support\_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome <dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcrwiki/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome>`__

-  `dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support\_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome <dav://mycompany.com:port/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/Groups/spaces/support_team/ApplicationData/eXoWiki/WikiHome>`__

After successful login, you will see the WebDAV drive with all content
in that Wiki space.

-  Each folder is a wiki page. The folder name is the same as the wiki
   page title.

-  "content" is the file that stores the page content.

Now you can access this drive anytime and manage its folders/files via
WebDAV. See `Editing a wiki page using WebDAV <#>`__ for more details.

**Editing a wiki page using WebDAV**

Go to the folder that contains the content you want to edit.

Use your text editor to edit the "Content" file in this folder. You can
use the wiki syntax to format content as normal.

Save the file.

    **Note**

    -  You can copy/move/delete a page by copying/moving/deleting the
       corresponding folder.
