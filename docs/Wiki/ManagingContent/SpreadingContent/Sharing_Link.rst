Sharing your links
==================

A permanent link of a space or a Wiki page allows you to share/restrict
its content with other users. To achieve it, do as follows:

Go to a Wiki page where you want to get its permanent link.

Click More in the Page Control area, then select Permalink

Or, click the Public/Restricted status indicated at the page header.

The Permalink form will display. This form shows the public/restricted
status of the Wiki page and the link to share.

-  If the page is public, click Restrict to restrict the access. The
   form will show that the page is changed into the restricted status
   and just the authorized users can view and edit it.

-  If the page is restricted, click Make Public to make it public. The
   form will show that the page is changed into the public status, and
   anyone can view and edit it.

**Managing the View and Editing permissions**

You can set the View and Edit permission to given users by clicking
Manage Permissions in the Permalink form. See the `Page
Permissions <#PLFUserGuide.WorkingWithWikis.AdvancedSettings.ManagingPermissions.PagePermissions>`__
section for more details.

    **Note**

    Manage Permissions is visible only to Space managers, to the page
    creator, and to the users that have the page Admin privilege.
