Publishing activity
===================

Once you have created a Wiki page, your activity will be automatically
published in the Activity Stream with the content abstract. However, if
you edit a Wiki page, you can choose to share that activity on the
Activity Stream so that people can notice your changes.

    **Note**

    To share your activity, the page you are working on must be public.

To do this, simply check Publish Activity and press Save to save changes
and publish the activity. You can also enter your comment in the Comment
field to display your comment with the activity.

People can view the changes you made by clicking |image0| and they will
be directed to the Compare Revisions page.
