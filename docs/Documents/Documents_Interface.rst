Documents Interface
===================

After logging into the **`Social Intranet
homepage <#PLFUserGuide.GettingStarted.SocialIntranetHomepage>`__**
successfully, you simply click **Documents** on the left panel to be
redirected to the **Documents** interface. As a normal user, you can
switch between **Icons** and **List** views by clicking |image0| or
|image1| respectively.

If you are an administrator, you can see **Documents** in the **Admin**
view.

    **Note**

    Refer to
    `Views <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ContentAdministration.WorkingWithExplorer.Views>`__
    to learn about differences between views.

The way to do actions on content is different between **Icons** and
**List** views as follows:

-  In the **Icons** view, you can do actions via the Right-click action
   or directly on the **Action** bar.

-  In the **List** view, the Right-click action is disabled.

Depending on your various purposes, you are free to switch between the
**Icons** and **List** views just in one click. That is, if you want to
see your content as images, it is recommended you use the **Icons**
view.

But in case you want to see more details directly in the view, the
**List** view is an optimal choice.

Here's what you can do in the **List** view:

-  Seeing important details of your content, including name,
   created/updated dates, creator, file size, directly in the view.
   Other information (such as extension, version number) is also present
   here, if any.

-  Showing/Hiding children of content without going inside it. Thus, you
   can have multiple folders opened in the view.

-  Changing the current context for a specific content simply clicking
   its name.

-  Doing basic actions on your content.
