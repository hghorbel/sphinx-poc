Navigating through Documents
============================

In the **Documents** application, you can store your content in both
drives and folders. However, to make ease for browsing your content, you
are advised to keep them in relevant folders. You can browse your
content in various ways, for example:

-  In the **Icons** view, double-click the content to open it.

-  In the **List** view, click |image0| to expand a specific folder that
   allows you to see its children without going into the folder. To hide
   its children, simple click |image1| to collapse this view.

-  Enter the path of the relevant content directly into the address bar.

   You can come back to the previous content by clicking |image3|.

-  Browse your content from the left sidebar in the **Icons** view. In
   the **List** and **Admin** views, the sidebar is disabled by default.
   To browse in this way, refer to `Hide explorer panel in
   sidebar <#HidingExplorerPanelInSidebar>`__.

-  Switch to another drive by clicking |image4| on the Action bar. A
   list of drives which are accessible to you will be shown.

       **Note**

       Depending on your role and permission, you will see various
       drives. See
       `Drives <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ContentAdministration.WorkingWithExplorer.Drives>`__
       for more details.
