=============================================

To share a document in the **Documents** application, do as follows:

Click **Documents** on the left panel, you will be redirected to the
**Documents** interface.

Select any document that you would like to share. If you are in the
**List** view, a Share button will appear in the Actions bar:

In case you are in the **Icons** view, right-click on the document to
see the Share button in the drop-down menu:

|image1|

    **Note**

    Only one file can be shared at a time, so you will not see the Share
    button if you choose more than one file simultaneously.

Click on the Share button, you will see a sharing dialog.

Type the first letter from the username/space to which you wish to share
the document. A drop-down list with the names of users and spaces having
that letter appears.

Select the users/spaces to which you want to share the document.

Select the permission, you can choose either can view, either can edit:

-  *Can View*: space members can only read the file.

-  *Can Edit*: space members can read and modify the file.

By default, the *Can View* permission will be applied.

    **Note**

    If you do not have the *Can Edit* permission on this document, only
    the *Can View* right is available for setting permissions.

Cick on add button |image4| to add the access right to the section *Who
has access*.

**Who has access section**

The *Who has access* section contains the list of spaces/users with whom
the document is shared and the persmission they have on it.

This list is sorted as follows:

-  The first entry of the list is the owner of the document, it cannot
   be removed.

-  When the document's owner validates to add new users/spaces with the
   corresponding permission, these contacts will be added in the bottom
   of the *Who has access* list, and the list view will be pointing to
   the last contact added.

-  Other entries are displayed in a scrollable area. Each entry contains
   : share target (user or space), permission (can edit or can view) and
   a delete icon.

    **Note**

    If the user enters a username that is not valid, the add button
    |image5| is not highlited and the user could not been added to the
    who has access list.

Add some comments or descriptions about the shared document into the
succeeding text box.

Click Apply to finish sharing this document with the selected spaces or
Cancel to skip sharing.

    **Note**

    -  After a document is shared successfully, a
       `symlink <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourDocuments.OrganizingYourContent.CreatingSymlink>`__
       will be created in the destination spaces and put into a folder
       named **Shared** in the **Documents** folder (if the folder does
       not exist in these spaces, it will be automatically generated
       while sharing a file). Therefore, the document could be shared
       again by any member of these spaces.

    -  This sharing activity will be automatically updated on the
       **Activity Stream**. Refer to `Sharing via Activity
       Composer <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourDocuments.SharingYourDocuments.SharingViaActivity>`__
       for more details.

    -  If the original file is deleted, all its associated symlinks in
       all spaces will be removed.
