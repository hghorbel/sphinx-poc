Viewing WebDAV
==============

WebDAV enables users to access, then read/write the content over the web
browser. Thanks to its benefits of easy, quick and flexible
manipulations and time-saving, WebDAV is often used to view the content.

Select the content you want to view WebDAV.

Click |image0| from the Right-click menu or on the Action bar.

With each type of content, the form to view in WebDAV will be different.
For example:

-  For *folder*: The list of children under the current folder will be
   displayed in WebDAV.

   |image1|

-  For *nt:file*: The content of the document will be shown.

In addition to web browser, you can access the content through another
WebDAV clients. See
`WebDAV <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.WebDAV>`__ for more
details.
