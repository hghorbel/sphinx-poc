Uploading files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uploading files from your local devices is a fast and efficient method
to create and store your documents in **Documents**.

.. note:: You now can upload multiple files from your local devices by holding
			Ctrl (on Windows) or Command (on Mac) to select them at the same time.

There are 2 available ways to upload:

-  :ref:`Using the Upload button <UsingUploadButton>`.

-  :ref:`Dragging and dropping <DraggingDropping>`.

When you start your upload, you will see the **Upload Status** window at
the bottom. In this window, the progress bar will appear next to the
files which are being uploaded.

-  Abort all uploads by clicking Abort all.

-  See necessary information of upload by clicking |image36|.

-  After your uploads are finished, you can click |image37| at the right
   top corner of the dropzone to close it.

-  Cancel your progressing upload by clicking |image38| next to the
   progress bar.


.. note:: -  The upload size depends on the size limit that your administrator
				set up in the 'Edit' mode of **Sites Explorer**. If your file
				size exceeds the limit, the alert message will appear.

		  -  If the name of your uploaded file is the same as that of an
				existing file in the same location into which you are going to
				upload, you will receive one warning in the dropzone that your
				file is already in use. Here you can decide to keep both (your
				uploaded file and the existing file), replace the existing file
				with your uploaded file or cancel your file upload.
