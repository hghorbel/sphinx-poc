If you do not want to represent a content with an existing but boring
icon, you can change this by adding your desired thumbnail to your
content.

1. Select content to which you want to add a thumbnail.

2. Select |image67| on the Action bar to open the Add Thumbnail Image form.

the display icon for your selected content.

view as below:
