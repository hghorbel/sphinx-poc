.. _OverloadingThumbnail:

Adding a thumbnail
==================

If you do not want to represent a content with an existing but boring
icon, you can change this by adding your desired thumbnail to your
content.

    **Note**

    This function is currently set in the **Icons** view only and you
    should have the appropriate permissions on the content.

Select content to which you want to add a thumbnail.

Select |image0| on the Action bar to open the Add Thumbnail Image form.

Click Choose Thumbnail Image to select the image which will be used as
the display icon for your selected content.

Click Save to accept your changes.

For example, you have the folder with a default icon in the **Icons**
view as below:

|image1|

After you have overloaded your desired thumbnail, the folder will be
displayed:

|image2|
