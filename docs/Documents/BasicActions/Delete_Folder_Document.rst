Deleting
========

    **Note**

    -  You can only take the **Delete** action if you have the
       permission on that drive.

    -  You can delete multiple content at the same time by holding the
       Ctrl (on Windows) or Command (on Mac) key and clicking the
       desired files and folders.

    -  If any folder is deleted, it means its child folders and
       references (if any) will be deleted accordingly.

**Deleting content**

Select |image0| from the Right-click menu or on the Action bar.

Click Delete in the confirmation message.

    **Note**

    If the deleted content has a symlink, this will be also deleted.

**Restoring content**

-  Once you have deleted the content, you will see a message at the top,
   indicating that your deletion is completed successfully. If you want
   to restore your deleted content immediately, click the Undo link.

-  The deleted content is stored in the **Trash** drive. By going to
   this drive and selecting Restore From Trash, you can restore your
   deleted content.

    **Note**

    -  Currently, only administrators have the right to access the
       **Trash** drive.

    -  Deleting any content from the **Trash** drive will remove them
       permanently.
