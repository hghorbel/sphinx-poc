Tagging a document
==================

A tag is a keyword or term associated with or assigned to a piece of
information (picture, geographic map, blog entry, clip, and more). Each
tag describes one item that enables the keyword-based classification and
search.

    **Note**

    All tags are in public. This means all users can view them. However,
    to edit or delete them, you need to have the appropriate right
    granted by your administrators.

**Adding a new tag**

Open the document for which you want to tag, then select |image0| on the
Action bar to open the Tag Manager form.

**Details:**

+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Field                | Description                                         |
+======================+=====================================================+
| Tag Names            | The tag names you want to add to your documents.    |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Linked Tags          | List of all tags added to your documents.           |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

Input a value into the Tag Names field. You can add many tags to one
document at one time by separating with commas.

Click Add to accept, or Close to quit.

    **Note**

    -  To view the whole list of tags, you just need to click on
       |image1| from the sidebar.

    -  In case many tags are added to the documents, the tags cloud is
       paginated:
