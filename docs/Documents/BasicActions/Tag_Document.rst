Tagging a document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A tag is a keyword or term associated with or assigned to a piece of
information (picture, geographic map, blog entry, clip, and more). Each
tag describes one item that enables the keyword-based classification and
search.

.. note:: All tags are in public. This means all users can view them. However,
			to edit or delete them, you need to have the appropriate right granted by your administrators.
