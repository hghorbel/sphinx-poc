 .. note::You cannot delete the Space Settings application because it is configured as a mandatory space application.

.. _Manage-space-navbar:

Managing space navigation bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each space is featured with some "pages" on the space navigation bar.
These pages may contain applications or any content. By clicking on each
page, you will be redirected to it.

|image22|

Also, you can easily manage these pages on the space navigation bar
through actions on the relevant navigation nodes. To do so, in Space
Settings, select the Navigations bar, then right-click the relevant
navigation node. See `Managing navigation
nodes <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingNavigations>`__
for more details.

|image23|

Creating a space page
-----------------------

To create a page that is accessible on the space navigation bar, simply
add a navigation node that links to your desired page in the Page
Selector tab. See `Adding a new
node <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingNavigations.AddingNewNode>`__
for more details.

|image24|

Also, you can create a space page using:

-  `Page Creation
   Wizard <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPages.AddingNewPage.PageCreationWizard>`__;
   Or

-  `Pages
   Management <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPages.AddingNewPage.PagesManagement>`__.
   In this case, Owner Type should be **group**, and Owner Id should be
   **/spaces/[space\_node\_name]**. For example, if you want to add a
   page to the space named PLF team, the Owner Id should be
   **/spaces/plf\_team**. Remember that in this way, you only create the
   space page that is still not accessible. To make this page
   accessible, create a node that links to this page (in the Page
   Selector tab).

Editing a space page
---------------------

To edit this space page, simply right-click the navigation node
containing the page and select Edit Node's Page from the context menu.
The **Edit Page** window will be displayed in the Page Properties view.
See `Editing a
page <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPages.EditingPage>`__
for more details.

Removing a space page
----------------------

If you right-click the node containing the page and select Delete Node
from the context menu, only the navigation node linking to the page will
be removed from the space navigation bar, but its page still exists. To
actually delete this page, see `Deleting a
page <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPages.DeletingPage>`__.
