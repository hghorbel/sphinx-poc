Joining/Leaving a space
=======================

.. _Join-space:

Joining a space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Go to the Spaces page <note-access-spaces-page>` and you will see All Spaces tab which displays all your spaces and ones
whose :ref:`Visibility <About-space-visibility>` is set to "Visible".

There are two cases to join a space:

-  **The first instance**: For spaces without validation required, click
   Join corresponding to your desired space. You will automatically
   become their members.

-  **The second instance**: For spaces with validation required, after
   clicking Request to Join, you have to wait for the validation from
   the space's manager who can accept or deny your request.

.. _Revoke-space-request:

Revoking your request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  To revoke your request for joining a space that has not been
   validated by its manager, simply click Cancel.

.. _Leave-space:

Leaving a space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  To leave a space, simply click Leave.

If you are the only leader of that space, the message which informs that
you cannot leave a space will appear as below.


 .. note::After you have left a space, the space will not exist in the My
			Spaces tab, but in the All Spaces tab (for the "visible" space
			only). You are not able to view activities of the spaces you have
			left unless those where you have been mentioned.
