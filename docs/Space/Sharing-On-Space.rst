To share an update, a document or a link in a space, you must be a
member first. Then follow these steps:

1. :ref:`Access to the space <Access-Space>` in which you want to publish a post.

2. Point to the space's activity stream.

3. Compose your text message or upload documents or attach a link in the activity composer. It is same as :ref:`Sharing in activity stream <Share-AS>`.

with the space name, the space avatar and the space description.

If you are a member in the space and not an administrator or creator, in
addition to the previously cited components, a Leave button is displayed
in the popover allowing you to leave the space and Chat button allowing
you to start a discussion with the space members.

Once you leave the space, you will not be able to see any activity, nor
receiving notifications of your former publications on this space

Only the space managers and authors of the posts can delete the
activities by clicking on the delete (1) icon in the corner. All
notifications related to that deleted activity in the space are also
deleted.
