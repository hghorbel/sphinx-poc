Or, you can search in the Spaces application that helps you easily find
spaces from one of the tabs in the `Space
navigation <#PLFUserGuide.WorkingWithSpaces.AccessingSpace.SpaceNavigation>`__.
To do this, click the MY SPACES link, or click Join a space on the left
panel to open the Spaces page first. After accessing your desired space
tab, you can search for spaces by **Name** and **Description** from the
Search textbox or by **Alphabets**.
