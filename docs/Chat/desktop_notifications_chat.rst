Desktop notifications
=====================

Users don't stay all the time on the chat page, that's why eXo Platform has
added desktop notifications to alert users on a new message received in
the chat, even when the browser window is minimized or hidden by another
one.

A desktop notification is a small popup displayed to the user to alert
him on a new message received in the chat.

Desktop notifications are sent only if you gave the permission to
recieve notifications through the web browser. You are requested to give
your permission the first time you access to chat application.

In case of a one to one chat room, the desktop notification contains:

-  the avatar of the user who sent the chat message,

-  the display name of the user who sent the chat message,

-  the beginning of the message,

-  a link at the bottom indicating the website from where the
   notification is coming from.

In case of a group chat (room or space), the desktop notification
contains:

-  the avatar of the group in which the chat message was sent,

-  the name of the chat group,

-  the name of the user who sent the message followed by the beginning
   of the message,

-  a link at the bottom indicating the website from where the
   notification is coming from.

When you receive the notification, clicking on it redirects you to the
corresponding conversation in the Chat application.

Global Notification Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Desktop notifications complement other ways to draw your attention to
new messages like the on-site counter and the bips. You can enable or
disable these channels through the Preferences screen.

-  You can enable/disable a notification channel by changing the
   position of the toggle on/off. By default, all the notification
   channels are enabled.

-  A Close button allows to dismiss the Preferences screen. The chat
   application displays the previously displayed room's conversation.

-  It is also possible to enable or disable notifications for *Do Not
   Disturb* chat status in the Preferences screen. By default, it is set
   to off.

-  If you enable notifications for *Do Not Disturb* status, this means
   that whatever your chat status is, you will receive notifications.


    .. tip:: You don't need to save the settings, they are immediately saved and applied.

In addition to the preferences that could be set for global chat
notifications, it is also possible to parameter notifications for each
room. For that purpose, follow these steps:

   notifications. You can select either one to one chat room or a group
   chat room.

-  |image5| Click on |image6| to display actions that you can do on that
   room.

A screen appears enabling you to set the chat room notifications
settings:

-  **Normal**: When you want to receive notifications for the chat room.

   chat room.
