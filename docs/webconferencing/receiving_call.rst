Receiving a call
================

When someone calls you and your chat status is "Available" or "Away",
you will hear a ringtone indicating an incoming call and you will also
receive a notification window no matter which page of the PRODUCT portal
you are on.

The notification window appears in the bottom right of your screen and
contains:

-  The caller's avatar.

-  A message which states, "[the user's display name]" is calling you,
   where the user's display name is the full name of the caller.

-  Two buttons, "Answer" and "Decline".

When you click on the Answer button, you accept the call and it opens
the call window which displays your camera stream. While the connection
is established, it also displays your caller's camera stream and your
own camera stream is miniaturised in the bottom-right corner.

When you click on the Decline button, you refuse the call and it
dismisses the incoming popover.



   .. note:: 1. Clicking on the Close button |image1| of the notification window allows you to also decline the call.

			 2. The same stands for :ref:`Placing a call <MakingVideoCalls>`, the camera and microphone settings remember previous status.
