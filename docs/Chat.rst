    eXo Char is an instant messaging application that allows users to
    sync up and take action quickly. Tightly integrated with eXo Platform 4,
    eXo Chat empowers the real-time collaboration among teams and
    individuals.

    Here is summary of what BRAND\_CHAT brings:

    -  **Discussions**: Create quick conversation with your contacts,
       from group to specific person.

    -  **Status**: Don't want to be interrupted, or not in the mood for
       a chat? Simply change your status from the Chat menu or directly
       in the chat window.

    -  **Favorites**: Add or remove your contacts to/from the favorites
       list with one click.

    -  **Collaboration**: Leverage collaboration with a set of actions
       (creating an event/task, sharing a link/file, asking a question
       or raising your hand), directly within BRAND\_CHAT.

    -  **Notifications**: Follow notifications sent to you in real time,
       read and answer messages immediately or later when you are free.

    -  **Recording**: Save your discussions from the beginning to the
       end that can be exported to a wiki page or sent to emails.
