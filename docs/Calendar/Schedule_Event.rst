   rather than entering each instance separately.

-  `Create a reminder for upcoming events <#CreatingEventReminder>`__
   with your own notification settings.

   participants <#ViewingTimeAvailability>`__.

          size of each file must be less than 10 MB.

events <#CreatingEventReminder>`__ section.

as stated in the `Adding participants to an
event <#AddingParticipantsToEvent>`__ section.

users, or change date and time for your event and apply them into the
Details tab. For more details, see the `Viewing the availability time of
participants <#ViewingTimeAvailability>`__ section.

Click Save to finish creating your detailed event.

A confirmation message will appear that allows you to save and send the
invitation, or only save.

If you create an event in a space, you will see the event updated in the
Activity Stream of your Space or Group Space.

The event will be updated in your Activity Stream with its brief
information, such as description, location, start time and end time. You

Repeat every and **WE** in Repeat on, the event will be repeated every 5
weeks on Wednesday.

Select the option for ending your repeating event by ticking the
relevant checkbox.

-  Never: Your repeating event will never end.

-  After [X] occurrences: Your repeating event will end after a defined
   number of occurrences.

   drop-down calendar.

The recurring event will be shown as below:

Editing an event
----------------

Open the Add/Edit Event form by doing one of two following ways:

**The first way**

Double-click the event you want to edit.

**The second way**

Right-click the event that you want to edit and select Edit from the
drop-down menu.

The Add/Edit Event form is displayed with information that is similar
when adding your event.

Edit information of the selected event to your desires, then click Save
to complete.

-  When you are editing the start time, the end time will be selected
   with the same duration as previously defined. For example, you create
   an event that starts at 10:00 and ends at 12:00 (duration of 2
   hours). When you edit the start time to 11:00, the suggested end time
   will be 13:00.

-  If you have made changes on a recurring event, the Edit recurring
   event pop-up will be displayed:

   |image21|

   -  Select Only this event. The changes will be applied into the
      selected event only. This event will be marked with the text:
      "Edited Recurring event".

      |image22|

   -  Select Following events. The changes will be applied into the
      selected event and following events of the series.

   -  Select All events. The changes will be applied into all events of
      the series.

    **Note**

    -  For shared and group calendars, you can only edit their events if
       you have the edit permission.

    -  When editing an event, you can add/remove the attachment files or
       download them by directly clicking their titles.

    -  If you only want to change the start date and time of the event,
       you can also use the drag-and-drop feature to edit the time for
       the event directly on the **Calendar View pane**.

**In a space calendar:**

If you set a repetition to an event or modify the event repetition, a
new comment will be added to the event activity.

|image23|

While editing a recurring event:

-  If you select Only this event or change the duration with the mouse,
   a new activity will be created for this instance on the activity
   stream.

-  If you select Following events, a new activity will be created for
   the starting event of the new series. Also, a comment which informs
   the date of repetition stop is added to the previous series.

   |image24|

-  If you select **All Events**, the main event activity is updated and
   a comment informing your changes is added to the activity.

Dragging and dropping an event
------------------------------

The drag-and-drop feature helps you change the start date and time of an
event more conveniently. You only need to click the event, drag and drop
it into another date or new time area in the **Calendar View pane**.

You also can hover your cursor over the **Scroll** button to alter the
event period.

According to the features of the Calendar pane view, the drag-and-drop
feature can be applied to the date and time differently.

-  In the Day view, all events are shown in a day, so you can change the
   time of the event in one day only.

-  In the Week and Work Week views, all events are shown in a week, so
   you can change both the event time and the event date.

-  In the Month view, all events are shown in a month, so you can change
   the event date only. You can also change more events at the same time
   by ticking their checkboxes and using the drag-and-drop feature.

    **Note**

    For shared and group calendars, you can only drag and drop their
    events if you have the **Edit** permission on these calendars. If
    you drag and drop an event of one calendar on which you do not have
    the edit permission, you will get a warning message.

Exporting/Importing an event
----------------------------

**Exporting an event**

This function allows you to export one event into a file on your device.
This file can be imported to use in another **Calendar** application.

Right-click the event that you want to export, then select Export from
the drop-down menu.

The Export Calendar form will appear.

Enter a file name, the export format is iCalendar by default.

Click Save to accept exporting the event.

Click **OK** in the confirmation message to save the exported file into
your device.

    **Note**

    In fact, exporting an event means exporting a calendar with one
    event only. Therefore, the exported file format and the way to
    export an event is similar to the way to export a calendar with
    multiple events.

**Importing an event**

You can import an event into a specific calendar. The process to import
an event is similar to importing a calendar. For more details, see
`Importing a
calendar <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourCalendars.ImportingCalendar>`__.

Deleting an event
-----------------

This function allows you to remove events from a calendar. To do this,
simply right-click the event you want to delete, then select Delete from
the drop-down menu.

**Deleting a recurring event**

If you delete a recurring event, the Delete Recurring Event popup will
be displayed:

|image25|

-  Select Only this event to delete the selected event only.

-  Select Following events to delete the selected event and following
   events of the series.

-  Select All events to delete all events of the series.

When you delete an edited recurring event in a space calendar, its
activity on the activity stream is also deleted and a comment informing
the date of the event cancelled is added to the main activity of the
series.

-  If you select Only this event, a comment informing the date of the
   event cancelled is added to the main activity of the series.

   |image26|

-  If you select Following events, and in case there are activities for
   some future edited recurring events of the series, they are deleted
   and a comment informing the date of repetition stop is added to the
   main activity of the series.

   |image27|

-  If you select All events, the main activity of the series is deleted.

In the Month view, you can delete one or multiple events at the same
time.

Tick the checkboxes corresponding to the events you want to delete.

Click |image28| on the **Month** information bar.
