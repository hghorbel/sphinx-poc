Managing categories
===================

Categories are used to classify events and tasks. For example, you could
use a 'Meeting' category for all meetings with your colleagues or
customers in your company. By default, PRODUCT provides 6 available
categories in Calendar: All, Calls, Meeting, Holiday, Clients,
Anniversary. You can add and view events/tasks in default categories. In
addition, you also can edit, delete default categories or create new
categories by yourself.

To manage categories, click |image0|, then select Add Event Category
from the drop-down menu.

The Event Categories form will appear.

**Adding a new category**

Simply enter the category name (that does not contain special
characters, for example #,$) in the Event Category field, then click Add
to add this category.

**Editing/Deleting a category**

-  **Edit a category** by clicking |image1|. Next, enter a new name in
   the Event Category field, then click Update to apply your changes.

-  **Delete a category** by clicking |image2|. Next, click Yes in the
   confirmation message.

       **Note**

       The events/tasks under the deleted categories are still kept.
       These events will then be auto-assigned to the default **All**
       category.
