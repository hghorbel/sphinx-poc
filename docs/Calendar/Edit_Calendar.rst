Editing a calendar
==================

    **Note**

    -  You can ONLY edit personal calendars and group calendars that you
       created.

    -  For group calendars which are created by another users, you can
       ONLY edit them if you are granted the **Edit** permission.
       Meanwhile, for shared calendars, you cannot edit them. If you are
       granted the **Edit** permission on them by the calendar creators,
       you can ONLY have the right on their tasks or events (for
       example, adding/modifying/deleting, exporting/importing).

Hover your cursor over the calendar which you want to edit, then click
|image0| that appears.

Click Edit from the drop-down menu. The form to edit the calendar will
be different, depending on your selected calendar type. For example, if
you select a personal calendar, the form only contains the Details tab.

Make changes on the calendar, then click Save to accept your changes.

**Setting the calendar color**

The **Calendar** application allows you to select different colors for
all types of calendars to recognize them easily.

Hover your cursor over the calendar which you want to set the color,
then click |image1| that appears.

Select one color from the available 24-color palette.

    are not granted the **Edit** permission.

Hover your cursor over the calendar which you want to delete, then click
|image3| that appears.

Select Remove from the drop-down menu.

Click Yes in the confirmation message.
