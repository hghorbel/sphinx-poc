Liking comments
===============

With PRODUCT 5, it is possible to express emotion on a user's comment to
a status or any other activity by liking the comment.

Under the comment text, a like icon is displayed |image0| which has 2
statuses:

-  The active status: When a user clicks on the like button, it turns to
   blue color.

-  The inactive status: The button is greyed when it is unclicked or
   clicked twice i.e first for liking and the second for removing like.

Clicking on the like button adds a number between brackets which
indicates the number of users who already liked the comment. If the like
button is already clicked and the user reclicks on it, it becomes
inactive and the number is decreased by 1.

-  Mousing over the number between brackets shows a popover which
   indicates the persons who liked the comment.

-  If the number of likers is more than 10, the pop over shows 9
   usernames and "X-9 more". To view the full list of usernames, you
   should click on the number between brackets.

-  Clicking on the number between brackets displays a popup named
   *People who liked* which lists the users who clicked the comment. The
   pop up contains:
