Commenting on activities
========================

This action allows you to get ideas, answers, and any additional
information when your collaborators respond to your status updates.
Besides, you can comment by yourself about any activities as follows:

Enter your comment into the Comment box and press the Comment button.
Your comment will be displayed right after the activity.


    .. note:: A formatting toolbar appears once you click in the comment composer.
    It allows you to change the formatting of your message, attaching
    images and links and preview how it will look once posted. (like
    what we have for `the activity stream
    composer <#PLFUserGuide.GettingStarted.ActivitiesInActivityStream.UpdatingStatus>`__)

When there are more than two comments on activity, 2 latest comments
will be displayed below the activity. You can click "View all XX
comments" (XX is the total number of comments) to view 10 more comments.
If some comments left are not displayed yet, click View previous
comments on the top of the comment part to view more.

You can mention people in your comment by "@" symbol into your activity
composer, then type the person name you want to mention. See `Mentioning
someone <#PLFUserGuide.GettingStarted.ActivitiesInActivityStream.MentioningSomeone>`__
for more details.
