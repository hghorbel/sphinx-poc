Posting Status Updates
======================

By posting a status update message in the activity stream, you can tell
your connections and other space members what you are working on or ask
for their help or ideas.

On the Activity Stream, you can enter a message in the **Activity
Composer** through one of these three tabs :

-  Message: allows you to post a simple text message.

-  File: allows you to post a message with attached files.

-  Link: allows you to post a message with an attached link.

A formatting toolbar appears once you click in the activity composer. It
allows you to format your message and to preview it before posting.

When you click on the link button, a popup appears containing an URL
area for the link and a text area for the URL label.

As a second way to display the popup, a click on Link after a right
click on the mouse displays the popup.

Once the Insert URL form popup is confirmed, the URL Label will be
displayed colored in Blue.
