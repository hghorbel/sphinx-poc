Click Apply to commit your changes.

    **Note**

    In PRODUCT, the priority order of the display language is as the
    following:

    User's language Cookies' language Browser's language Site's language

    It means the language set by the user will be at the highest level,
    and the site's language at the lowest level.

    Accordingly, you should pay attention to this order when selecting
    your preferred display language.
