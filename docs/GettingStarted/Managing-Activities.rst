After logging in, you will be directed to the Intranet homepage as
below.

You can see activities of other users by clicking their display name to
reach their profile page, then selecting Activity Stream. However, for
people that are not in your connections, you only can view their
activities but cannot **post**, **comment** or **like** on their
activity streams.

The homepage also aggregates activities from spaces, so you can keep
track of their activities without visiting every space. For example,
when there is a new post in a forum of a given space, it is displayed in
**Activity Stream** of the space and of the Social Intranet homepage.

You can filter what you want to see on the homepage:

-  |image0| **All Activities**: shows all activities from spaces,
   connections and your activities. This stream is selected by default.

-  |image1| **My Spaces**: only shows activities created in spaces where
   you are member.

-  |image2| **Connections**: shows activities created by your
   connections.

-  |image3| **My Activities**: shows your activities (inside and outside
   a space) and activities where you were
   `mentioned <#PLFUserGuide.GettingStarted.ActivitiesInActivityStream.MentioningSomeone>`__
   in, that you liked or where you left comments.

To access your **Activity Stream** page, click your display name on the
top navigation bar, then select **My Activities**.

You will be then directed to your **Activity Stream** page.

    .. note::

    In **Activity Stream**, the order of activities is based on the last
    date when you create a publication action, or post a new comment.
    This means the last publication or comment will be auto-updated and
    pushed up to the top of the **Activity Stream** so that you will not
    miss any recent activities.
