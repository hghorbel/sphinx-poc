Forgot Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you forget your password, you can request the system to send you a
link to reset it. The link will be sent to your email. It helps if you
forget the username also, but it requires an email that is set in your
account properly.

In Login screen, click *Can't access your account?* link.

In next screen, input your username or email, then click Send.

Check your mailbox. The email looks like this:

Click the link in the email, then input your new password and click
Save.

If the password is saved successfully, a popup will notify you in
seconds, then you are redirected to the Login screen.

In case the link has been expired already, you will see a notification
like this:

The link expires as soon as you successfully reset the password, or
after 1 day by default. The system administrators can `configure the
expiration time <#PLFAdminGuide.Configuration.ForgotPassword>`__.
