Switch *Stay signed in* to Yes if you want to automatically return to this

"*This user account has been suspended. If you think this is an error,
please contact the administrator.*\ ".

    .. note:: After selecting Stay signed in, if you do not sign out when you leave the portal, you will be automatically authenticated for your next visit.
