This section provides a number of terms that you will encounter when
implementing eXo Platform.

**Site**

A web-based environment which is used for aggregating and personalizing
information via specific applications with an interactive and consistent
look and feel. Users and administrators are able to integrate
information, people and processes via a web-based user interface.

**Portlet**

An applicative component pluggable to a site through which users can
access some specific information, including supports, updates, or
mini-applications. The portlet produces fragments of a markup code that
are aggregated into a page. Typically, a page is displayed as a
non-overlapping portlet windows collection, where each portlet window
displays a portlet. Content generated by a portlet can be customized,
depending on the configuration set by each user. **Portlets** can be
divided into two following types:

-  **Functional portlets** which support all functions of a site. They
   are built into the site and accessed via toolbar links when the
   site-related tasks are performed.

-  **Interface portlets** which constitute the eXo Platform interface as
   front-end components of the site.

**Super-user**

A super-user is a special user who has full privileges and used for the
administration. In eXo Platform, this account is configured with Root, Root,
root@localhost and its memberships are
member:/organization/management/executive-board,
\*:/platform/administrators, \*:/platform/users,
\*:/platform/web-contributors, \*:/organization/employees. A super-user
has all permissions on all features of eXo Platform.

**Navigation**

A set of menus (sometimes so-called node tree) that contains hyperlinks
to other parts of a site. The default navigation menus in eXo Platform are
located in the top navigation bar:

**Space**

A collaboration workspace where you can share documents, tasks, events,
wikis and more. A space can be open or closed, private or public and
space administrators can manage members and applications that are
available.

**Connection**

A bond among people in a network. By connecting to other people, you
will be able you to track their activities through the activity stream.

**Activity**

An activity is published on the Activity Stream and allows you to follow
what your connections are sharing, such as links to documents or just
moods. An activity can be made out of different parts:

-  The author

-  The author's avatar

-  The space

-  The type of the activity (for instance Documents, Wiki, Forums,
   Spaces or Connections)

-  The activity message

-  The featured content

-  The action bars including the buttons Comment and Like

-  The like section

-  The comment section

**Gadget**

A mini web application which is run on a platform and can be integrated
and customized in the website. You can add these gadgets to your
dashboards by yourself.

**Modes**

eXo Platform offers two access modes by default:

-  **Public mode** is for guest users (visitors) who are not registered.
   In this mode, you are not required to sign in, but limited to public
   pages in the site. After being registered successfully, you can use
   the private mode, but must contact the site administrators to get
   more rights or the group manager to become the member and gain the
   access to the group.

-  **Private mode** is for registered users who will apply their
   usernames and passwords to sign in. This mode supports users in
   taking many actions, such as creating private pages, editing or
   deleting them, "borrowing" pages from others by creating hyperlinks,
   changing languages to their individual needs, managing private
   information.

**Permission**

**Permission** settings control actions of a user within the site and
are set by the administrators. See `Managing
permissions <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.ManagingPermissions>`__
for more details.

**Repository**

A locus where content or digital data are maintained. Users can access
without traveling across a network.

**Drive**

A shortcut to a specific location in the content repository that enables
administrators to limit visibility of each workspace for groups of
users. It is also a simple way to hide the complexity of the content
storage by showing only the structure that is helpful for business
users.

In details, a drive consists of:

-  A configured path where the user will start when browsing the drive.

-  A set of allowed views that will allow the user to limit the
   available actions, such as editing or creating content while being in
   the drive.

-  A set of permissions which limits the access and view of the drive to
   a specified number of people.

-  A set of options to describe the behavior of the drive when the users
   browse it.

**Node**

An abstract unit used to build linked data structures, such as linked
lists and trees, and computer-based representation of graphs. Nodes
contain data and/or links to another nodes. Links between nodes are
often implemented by pointers or references.

Also, a node can be defined as a logical placeholder for data. It is a
memory block which contains some data units, and optionally a reference
to some other data. By linking one node with other interlinked nodes,
very large and complex data structure can be formed.

**WebDAV**

This term stands for Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning. In
eXo Platform, it is used as a mean to access the content repository directly
from the **Sites Explorer**.

**Symlink**

A special file which contains a reference to a document or a folder. By
using symlinks, you can easily access specific nodes (target) to which
symlinks point. In **Documents**, a symlink has a small chain symbol
next to its icon.
