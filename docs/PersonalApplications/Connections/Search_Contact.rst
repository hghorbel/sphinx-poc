Search for contacts
===================

This function allows you to find your desired contact quickly by
searching by name, position, and/or work skills, and searching by
alphabets.

Select a relevant tab in the My Connections page to do your search:

-  To search across all users in PRODUCT, select the Everyone tab, or
   click Connections on the left pane to search in the Contacts
   Directory page.

-  To reduce the returned search results, select an appropriate tab in
   the My Connections page before using the search box. For example, to
   search for contacts with whom you have established connections, you
   should select the My Connections tab.

Select the search criteria:

-  **Search by name**: Enter the contact name you want to search into
   the Search by Name field. When you type, the application
   automatically suggests contact names containing your entered letter.
   You just need to select one of suggested names from the drop-down
   list.

-  **Search by position/skills**: Enter the position, and/or skills of
   the contacts you want to search for into the corresponding box.

-  **Search by alphabets**: See details in the `Search by
   alphabets <#SearchingByAlphabets>`__ section. (If you search by this
   criteria, skip **Step 3**).

Hit the Enter key, or click Search to find your desired contacts.

    **Note**

    -  When searching by alphabets, only contacts whose last names start
       with the search letter are listed in the Contacts Directory page.

    -  The search results are also ordered by the last name.
