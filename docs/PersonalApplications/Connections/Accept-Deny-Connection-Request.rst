-  At the first time when you connect to a user in the network, a new
   activity will be created on the activity stream. This activity always
   shows the total number of your connections, for example, "I'm now
   connected with 10 users". Additionally, a comment which informs that
   you are connecting with him is added to the activity. Each of your
   later connection will also create a new comment added to the
   activity.

-  If you `remove your
   connection <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourPersonalApplications.ManagingYourConnections.DisconnectingFromYourContacts>`__
   with a user, the number of your connections will be updated to the
   activity.
