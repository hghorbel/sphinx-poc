workspace <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourPersonalApplications.ManagingYourDashboard.UsingDashboardWorkspace>`__
and to `add more external gadgets from

   gadgets <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourPersonalApplications.ManagingYourDashboard.BuiltinGadgets>`__

-  `Changing gadget
   preferences <#PLFUserGuide.ManagingYourPersonalApplications.ManagingYourDashboard.ChangingGadgetPreferences>`__

This portlet is to host mini-applications known as gadgets. The
dashboard uses a variety of graphical effects for displaying, opening
and using gadgets.

    **Note**

    You can open many gadgets with different settings at once.

**Using the dashboard workspace** Click your display name on the top
navigation bar, then click My Dashboard from the drop-down menu to
access the My Dashboard portlet. Click Add Gadgets to open the Dashboard
Workspace window which lists all available gadgets. Select a gadget in
the Dashboard Workspace window and drag and drop it into the My
Dashboard page.

**Adding more external gadgets from Dashboard** Obtain the URL (.xml or
.rss) of the gadget you want to add from the gadgets source. For
example, *http://bejeweledg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bejeweled.xml.*
Remote gadgets can be only created using an .xml link or RSS URL.
However, if you use a link that generates an RSS feed (for example,
http://feeds.feedburner.com/gatein), a new RSS reader gadget will be
created automatically even if the URL does not end with *.rss*. Open the
`Dashboard Workspace <#OpenDashboardWorkspace>`__ window. Paste the URL
in Step 1 into the textbox. Click |image0| to add the new gadget to the
page.
