Managing your notifications
===========================

eXo Platform provides you a complete notification function which helps you to
avoid missing anything in your organization. As from eXo Platform 4.2, there
are 2 notification types that you can use.

.. _On-site:

On-site
~~~~~~~~

This real-time notification helps you receive new information without a
browser refresh. Whenever there is a new activity happening within your
network, it will be pushed into your notifications menu accompanied by
the number of unread messages as follows:

When you click the Notification icon, all notifications will be listed
starting from the most recent one:

By clicking each notification item, you will be redirected to the
corresponding activity stream or you can select **View All** to see all
notifications. Besides, the **Mark all as read** function allows you to
change all messages on this menu into the read status. Finally, to
remove any notification item, simply click the corresponding |image2|.

.. _Via-emails:

Via emails
~~~~~~~~~~~


Besides on-site notifications, you are totally able to keep track of
activities and events via emails. In eXo Platform, it is easy to control your
own email notifications from a single location in the user settings.
When this function is enabled, you will receive emails in 2 ways:

-  A notification email with different content for each event type. For
   example, for the activity embedding a video, the message will be
   represented as a thumbnail image of the embedded media, like below:

   |image3|

   By clicking the **Watch the video** link, you will be redirected to
   the activity stream where you can play the embedded video.

-  A digest email that collects all notifications during a certain
   period and is sent once per day or per week.

    .. note:: To receive notification and digest emails as well as on-site
				notifications, your administrator must enable notification plugins
				first. See `Notification administration <#PLFUserGuide.AdministeringeXoPlatform.NotificationAdministration>`__ for details.
