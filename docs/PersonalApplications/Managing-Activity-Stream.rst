.. _Managing-Activity-Stream:

Managing your activity stream
=============================

From the drop-down menu of your display name, select My Activities. You
will be redirected to your own activity stream page.

Here, you can see your activities (inside and outside a space) and
activities where you were
`mentioned <#PLFUserGuide.GettingStarted.ActivitiesInActivityStream.MentioningSomeone>`__,
liked or left comments.

The activities in My Activities are similar to those in `My
Activities <#MyActivities>`__ of the Social Intranet homepage. See
`Using the Activity
Stream <#PLFUserGuide.GettingStarted.ActivitiesInActivityStream>`__ for
more details.

    **Note**

    Your activity stream page (``../activities/[username]``) is visible
    to anyone even if they are not your connections. They can comment or
    like on your activity stream page. However, only your connections
    can see the Activity Composer that enables them to post on your
    stream.
