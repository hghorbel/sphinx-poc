Working with your wiki
======================

Every user has his own wiki where he stores his private Wiki pages or
works on drafts before being published on the public Wiki. From the
drop-down menu of your display name, select My Wiki to be redirected to
your own Wiki page. See the `Working With
Wikis <#PLFUserGuide.WorkingWithWikis>`__ chapter for the full details.

    .. note:: Your wiki page is private by default. This means only you and your
    administrator can access this via the link
    (``.../wiki/user/[username]``). However, if you have `made
    public <#PLFUserGuide.WorkingWithWikis.ManagingContent.SpreadingContent.SharingLink.MakingPublic>`__
    for your own wiki, anyone can access, read and edit it via the link.
