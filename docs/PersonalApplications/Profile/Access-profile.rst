By default, your profile is just initialized with the basic account
information as below:

This layout enables you to view:

-  your **Status** which is indicated by a round shape displayed next to
   your name with corresponding colors:

   -  green - "*Available*\ ".

   -  red - "*Do not disturb*\ ".

   -  yellow - "*Away*\ ".

   -  grey - "*Offline*\ ".

-  your **Contact Information**, such as *email*, *gender*.

-  your **Recent Activities** that lists the latest activities
   concerning yourself or with which you reacted (comment, like). You
   can either click on each item of the list to jump to the
   corresponding activity stream with full information, or select View
   All button to go to the expanded list.

-  your **People** that displays the most recent connections you have
   made. From the scratch, if you do not have anyone in your network, a
   message saying "*You do not have connections yet.*\ " will be
   displayed. By clicking **Find connections**, you will be redirected
   to the `Search for
   contacts <#PLFUserGuide.SearchingIneXoPlatform.RefiningYourSearch.SearchingForContact>`__
   page.

    .. note::

    When you change the information of your profile at the first time,
    an activity will be created on the activity stream. Also, a comment
    informing your change is added to the activity. Your later changes
    will automatically create comments updated to the activity.
